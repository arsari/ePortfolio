## Overview

Code reviews catch errors when they’re cheap to fix, strengthen the team’s abilities, and add a certain amount of fault tolerance to the organization or individuals to better recover from disruptive changes. It results in better code, which is more easily maintained. Exercising a code review of the selected artifacts for software design and engineering, algorithms and data structure, and databases helped me to capacitate and employ strategies that help in the building of collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science based on the critical elements of existing functionality code analysis, and enhancements.

I analyze the three artifacts original code for weaknesses, limitations, and vulnerabilities and explain my plan for enhancements. The code review was a walk-through of the existing source code and planned improvements to the artifacts. Through the developed videos, I continue improving my abilities to deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communication techniques to effectively explain a code review through collaborative environments that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.

[Inventory Mobile Application - CS360 Mobile Architect and Programming](CS360 "CS360 Mobile Architect and Programming Original Code")

The application was planned, designed, and developed as part of the computer science course CS360 Mobile Architecture and Programming. The app's goal is to track an inventory of items using a mobile device. I developed the mobile app in the JAVA programming language with integration to SQLite database language.

[Zoo Monitoring System Program - IT145 Foundation in Application Development](IT145 "IT145 Foundation in Application Developmen Original Code")

The program was planned, designed, and developed as part of the IT145 Foundation in Application Development computer science course. The program aims to create an authentication system that manages authentication and authorization for zookeeper users and administrators. The program is developed in the JAVA programming language running in the NetBeans internal terminal console.

[Salvare Search for Rescue Web Application - CS340 Client/Server Development](CS340 "CS340 Client/Server Development Original Code")

The web app was planned, designed, and developed for the CS340 Client-Server Development computer science course. The application aims to create a web interface that works with an existing database from animal shelters to identify and categorize available dogs to train for different rescues. The application is developed in Python with the Dash framework and the non-relational database MongoDB. Python and MongoDB are integrated through the use of the PyMongo driver. Jupyter Notebook is used as a test tool to run the web application.
