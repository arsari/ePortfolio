## Overview

> *Note: This is the original repository of artifact for SNHU IT145 Foundation in Application Development 18EW5 computer science course. For the enhancement repository and fully operational mobile application visit the [ePortfolio - Algorithms and Data Structure](https://arsari.github.io/ePortfolio/#algorithms "Arturo Santiago-Rivera - ePortfolio Algorithms and Data Structures Category")*

Managing a Zooâ€™s computer infrastructure includes two key components: controlling the access to system data and monitoring the animal/habitat activities in exhibits. As a duty of the role of managing the computer infrastructure, we must develop a working program and detailed documentation describing the development process for the authentication and authorization of the people to gain access to data in the computer systems.

The program is designed and developed in JAVA language. The program is best to run in the computer terminal (macOS) or command prompt/PowerShell (Windows). For the terminal color we use the Jansi 1.4.0 JAVA library. I worked the program to handle errors by determining if it runs through the NetBeans output shell or OS cmd or terminal shell/bash.

**For a detailed description, function, and screen examples, please read the [Word Document](CS340-M7-1_Paper.pdf) paper.**

### Program Execution

To compile and run the program, in the computer terminal, `cd` to the directory where the program files and directory are located and execute the following commands:

`javac -cp ./org; classes/*.java ZooMonitorSystem.java`

`java ZooMonitorSystem`
