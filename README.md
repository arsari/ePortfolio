## Overview

This repository documents the procedures of developing our ePortfolio throughout the CS499 Computer Science Capstone course. Developing a professional portfolio that showcases our unique abilities and talents is best to demonstrate our value to potential employers. The content of the ePortfolio is a solid starting point to clear ideas that will showcase our skills across the key fields of Computer Science. The included artifacts of some of the courses in the Computer Science Program represent our growth in the key categories of software design/engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.

Some artifacts demonstrate our skills in one category and may illustrate skills across others of the key categories. As an own program practice, the artifacts chosen have been enhanced and presented beyond the course requirements, establishing a quality of work, addressing their limitations or inconsistencies, and mitigating vulnerabilities. The portfolio will convey the impression that we are strongly motivated, well organized, and accomplished in Computer Science major in Software Engineering.

### Self-Reflections

[Journal: Self-Introduction](CS499/CS499-M1-1_Paper.pdf "Journal: Self-Introduction")

This paper is an informative self-introduction related to the computer science courses concepts applicable to my personal experiences. It is about sharing personal opinions and viewpoints and engaging with course concepts and materials deeper, more reflective.

[Journal: Career Choice](CS499/CS499-M4-1_Paper.pdf "Journal: Career Choice")

This paper reflects on our career choice and plans for the future due to the Computer Science program. A recall of why we have remained more consistent in our career plans and how our thinking about our career has evolved. We comment on some research conducted about our career choice and how this has impacted our thinking.

### ePortfolio Selection and Software Design Document

[ePortfolio Initial Plan](CS499/CS499-M1-4_Paper.pdf "ePortfolio Initial Plan")<br/>
[ePortfolio Wireframe](CS499/CS499-M1-4_Wireframe.pdf "ePortfolio Wireframe")

This paper is an initial plan describing how it we meet the ePortfolio requirements. While the plan submitted was not final, it is a solid starting point with clear ideas for review. This assignment may be seen as a way of beginning a conversation that result in a challenging but practical plan to produce an ePortfolio that showcase our skills across the key fields of computer science:

* Software engineering and design
* Algorithms and data structure
* Databases

### Code Review

[Software Design and Engineering Artifact](CS499/CS499-M2-2_CodeReview01-SoftwareDesign.mp4 "Code Review Video")<br/>
[Algorithms and Data Structure Artifact](CS499/CS499-M2-2_CodeReview02-Algorithm.mp4 "Code Review Video")<br/>
[Databases Artifact](CS499/CS499-M2-2_CodeReview03-Databases.mp4 "Code Review Video")

We perform a code review in video for each of the artifacts selected in our initial plan. In this code review, we analyze existing code for weaknesses, limitations, and vulnerabilities, and explain our plan for enhancements. This code reviews are a walk-through of existing code and planned enhancements. It demonstrate the following critical elements for each category:

* Existing functionality: A detailed walk-through of the existing code focused on the features and function of the existing code.
* Code Analysis: Target areas of improvement in areas such as structure, logic, efficiency, functionality, security, testing, commenting, and documenting.
* Enhancements: A walk-through of planned enhancements that address issues raised in the code analysis.

### Software Design and Engineering Enhancement

[Software Design and Engineering Narrative](CS499/CS499-M3-2_Paper "Software Design and Engineering - Inventory Mobile App")

This paper is a narrative that accompanies the artifact enhancements for software design and engineering. It explains why the selected artifact was included in this category of our ePortfolio and reflects on the process used to create the artifact. The narrative focuses on the learning that happened through the artifact's creation. The artifact demonstrate our ability to use innovative skills and techniques for implementing design solutions and accomplishing goals. The ability to program solutions to solve logic problems in software and to address potential design flaws related to security.

### Algorithms and Data Structure Enhancement

[Algorithms and Data Structure Narrative](CS499/CS499-M4-2_Paper.pdf "Algorithms and Data Structure - Zoo Monitor System Program")

This paper is a narrative that accompanies the artifact enhancements for algorithms and data structure. It explains why the selected artifact was included in this category of our ePortfolio and reflects on the process used to create the artifact. The narrative focuses on the learning that happened through the artifact's creation. The artifact consists of design considerations to authenticate and authorize a user into the monitor system based on user credentials and the accountability of the user interaction with different modules screen and actions according to their role in the monitor system.

### Databases Enhancement

[Databases Narrative](CS499/CS499-M5-2_Paper.pdf "Databases - Salvare Search for Rescue Web App")</br>
[Web Application Demo](CS499/CS499-M5-2_WebApp-Windows-Demonstration.mp4 "Salvare Search for Rescue Web App - Demo")

This paper is a narrative that accompanies the artifact enhancements for databases. It explains why the selected artifact was included in this category of our ePortfolio and reflects on the process used to create the artifact. The narrative focuses on the learning that happened through the artifact's creation. The artifact involved a multi-tier application with a Model View Controller (MVC) and RESTful protocol design to extend the HTTP protocol to provide an application programming interface (API). The most attractive concept of the MVC pattern is a separation of concerns.
