## Overview

A professional portfolio that showcases our unique abilities and talents is the best way to demonstrate our value to potential employers. The content of the ePortfolio is a solid starting point to clear ideas that will showcase our skills across the key fields of Computer Science. The included artifacts of some of the courses in the Computer Science Program represent our growth in the key categories of software design/engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Some artifacts demonstrate our skills in one category and may illustrate skills across others of the key categories. The artifacts chosen have been enhanced beyond the course requirements, establishing a quality of work, addressing their limitations or inconsistencies, and mitigating vulnerabilities. The portfolio will convey the impression that I am strongly motivated, well organized, and accomplished in Computer Science major in Software Engineering.

### Self-Introduction

[Journal: Self-Introduction](CS499/CS499-M1-1_Paper.pdf "Journal: Self-Introduction")

This paper is an informative self-introduction related to the computer science courses concepts applicable to my personal experiences. It is about sharing personal opinions and viewpoints and engaging with course concepts and materials deeper, more reflective.

### ePortfolio Selection and Software Design Document

[ePortfolio Initial Plan](CS499/CS499-M1-4_Paper.pdf "ePortfolio Initial Plan")

This paper is an initial plan describing how it will meet the ePortfolio requirements. While the plan submitted was not final, it is a solid starting point with clear ideas for our instructor to review. This assignment may be seen as a way of beginning a conversation that will result in a challenging but practical plan to produce an ePortfolio that will showcase our skills across the key fields of computer science.
