## Welcome

This ePortfolio integrates the knowledge and skills gained and developed throughout my years of studying a the Computer Science program at SNHU. It is representative of my growth in the program.

I started the Computer Science program in January of 2018, having studied for as long as five years. I decided to join the program to improve my background in the programming and development of applications and web services. This extra effort was because of my love to work with computers, perform web development, and have led some IT projects and implement IT infrastructures and assistance during my years of practicing Architecture.

During my years in the CS program, I have improved my understanding of Software design and engineering, algorithms and data structure, and databases. I also learned about the software development life cycle and workflow in individual and collaborative projects.
