I contend that this artifacts enhancements demonstrated my abilities to use well-founded and innovative techniques. I implemented computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals exemplified through the development of functionalities that involves CSV data files being imported into MongoDB, the import of dependencies such as Python PyMongo driver, Python libraries, Dash framework, and a Python source code, and CRUD module to manipulate the data imported into MongoDB.

I designed and evaluated computing solutions that solve given problems using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices through the engineering considerations of relationship and functionality between the different classes and methods by using arguments, parameters, and variables in scope in JAVA programming.

All the enhanced artists demonstrate my emphasis on applying a security mindset during the development process to anticipate adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.
